# compeco package

# Exported functions in the `compeco` package as of `r lubridate::today()`

- `ce_convert_rfus()`: Converts input RFUs to concentration
- `ce_prep_rfu_file()`: Prepares input files to get converted into concentration.  Might end up being an internal function
- `ce_process_buoy_data()`: Function to fetch buoy data from newftp.epa.gov and merge into an rda
- `ce_process_exo_data()`: Prepares and combines data files from handheld YSI exo2

# To Do
- On 2021-12-14: Keep working on standard curve function
  - Keep working on blanking chl spec (look for the browser())
  - Subtract nm664 - nm750
    - done for blanked spec
    - need to do for unblanked spec
    - will need to grab a spec file with unblanked (March 2) for example
  - Other stuff...
  - Need to pull out values we need from each to build the regression
  - Other things: Add warning when solid standard from sample run is > 5% from curve and then error when difference is gt 10%
  - Expose acceptable value of years to user somehow.


- rename input raw data files: instead of multiple dates in file name, use last date for run
  - no: chla_2021_8_11_&_31_&_9_15_&_10_13_&_11_4.csv
  - yes: chla_2021_11_4.csv

# compeco package

# Exported functions in the `compeco` package as of `r lubridate::today()`

- `ce_convert_rfus()`: Converts input RFUs to concentration
- `ce_prep_rfu_file()`: Prepares input files to get converted into concentration.  Might end up being an internal function
- `ce_process_buoy_data()`: Function to fetch buoy data from newftp.epa.gov and merge into an rda
- `ce_process_exo_data()`: Prepares and combines data files from handheld YSI exo2
- `ce_read_exo_data()`: Reads in an exo data file
- `ce_get_nla_data()`: Function to download, clean, and merge NLA data.  This standardizes our approach, across projects, for getting this data.

# To Do
- clean up conc in ce_convert_to_conc
  - dilutions - probably only for SuRGE - should just be a multiply by dilution factor
  - dups, depth, reps, dilution even if not currently used
    
  - Double check ours/their fluorometer files to make sure A sample is highest and F sample is lowest. 

- rename input raw data files: instead of multiple dates in file name, use last date for run
  - no: chla_2021_8_11_&_31_&_9_15_&_10_13_&_11_4.csv
  - yes: chla_2021_11_4.csv

# Other ideas
- Maybe: Instead of spec/fluor for std curve internal to package, maybe also allow a user specified file(s) for that calculation.
- Is there a diff between fresh and salt?
